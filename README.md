This is for the final projects of the Computer Parallel subject, given by Alexandro Baldassin @ Unesp, Rio Claro.

## How to Run

Please check that you have Node.js installed with npm. If you don't know where to start, check https://nodejs.org/.

Then run what a usual Node.js application needs:

```shell
npm install
```

Finally, run our application:

```shell
npm start # works the same for: node index.js
```
